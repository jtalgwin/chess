# chess
Some tinkering with chess applications in Python.
  - simple-jupyter-chess-01 was a first attempt at creating a Jupyter Lab/notebook front-end for the python-chess package that would allow move entry and play vs. a random-move making 'engine'.  This built upon the example workbook available [here](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/CS371%20Cognitive%20Science/2016-Fall/Programming%20a%20Chess%20Player.ipynb).
  - simple-jupyter-chess-02 is a re-write of simple-jupyter-chess-01 that utilizes ipywidgets to create a more interactive UI.  

See the notebooks for instructions/additional information.
